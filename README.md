# Website Project README

## Introduction

This README file provides an overview of the website project that was created from scratch using VisualStudio IDE. The project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it was initiated on July 17, 2022.

## Project Overview

- **Project Start Date:** July 17, 2022

This project is a website built entirely from scratch, meaning that no pre-made templates or frameworks were used. It is composed of three core technologies:

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** HTML is used for structuring the content of the website, defining its layout, and organizing various elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, forms, and more.

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS is employed to style and format the website, including its layout, colors, fonts, and visual presentation. It ensures a consistent and visually appealing user experience.

3. **JavaScript (JS):** JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website. It enables features such as form validation, animations, dynamic content loading, and more.

## Development Tools

- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** VisualStudio was used as the primary development environment for this project. It provides a robust set of tools for web development, including code editing, debugging, and project management.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories and files to maintain a clean and structured codebase. Here's a brief overview of the project's structure:

- **about.html:** This is the main HTML file, serving as the entry point for the website. It defines the overall structure and content of the site.

- **styles.css:** The CSS file is responsible for styling the website's elements, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent design.

- **slider.js:** JavaScript logic is contained in this file. It adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website.

- **images/:** This directory stores image files used in the website. Images are organized here for easy management.
